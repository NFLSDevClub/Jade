# JaDE
JaDE (or Jade) is the abbreviation of **Ja**va **D**anmaku **E**ngine.

It's a java framework running on libgdx(lwjgl) intended to create Touhou-like danmaku games.  
The project is built on gradle, generated by gdx-setup.

It's still in early development phase, so large structural changes and informal coding style are common.
